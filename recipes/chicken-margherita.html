        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is my absolute favorite dish to make at home. I consider it my ultimate comfort meal. This recipe can be prepared in one pan for easy clean up!</p>
        <p>You could also add pasta if you wanted to stretch it, but I like it served by itself in a bowl.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound chicken thighs or breasts</li>
            <li>1/2 cup dry white wine</li>
            <li>salt to taste</li>
            <li>1 cup prepared pesto</li>
            <li>2 tbsp Butter</li>
            <li>1 tbsp minced garlic, or more to taste </li>
            <li>1 tbsp flour</li>
            <li>1 tbsp lemon juice</li>
            <li>1/2 cup chicken broth</li>
            <li>1 large package of grape or cherry tomatos, cut in half</li>
            <li>8 oz shredded mozzerella cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Brown your chicken in a large skillet and season to taste, I prefer various italian seasonings for this</li>
            <li>Remove your chicken from the pan and set aside</li>
            <li>Deglaze the pan with the wine. Be sure to scrape the bottom with a wooden spoon or rubber spatula to fully dissolve the brown bits</li>
            <li>Reduce heat to medium and melt the butter in the skillet, once fully melted add the garlic and saute for about a minute</li>
            <li>Add the flour and stir to break up any lumps, then add the lemon juice and chicken broth and cook for 3-5 minutes until it begins to thicken</li>
            <li>In the mean time, chop the chicken into bite-sized pieces.</li>
            <li>When the lemon garlic sauce is ready, add in the pesto and return the chicken to the pan.</li>
            <li>Add the halved tomatoes to the pan and cook, covered, for 3-5 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through</li>
            <li>Once the chicken is fully cooked, add in the mozzerella cheese and cover for 2 more minutes</li>
            <li>The dish is ready to serve. Pair with garlic bread or serve over pasta</li>
        </ol>
