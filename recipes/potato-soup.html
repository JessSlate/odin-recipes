        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Another of my one-pot meals, can you tell doing the dishes is my least favorite chore?</p>
        <p>Cheesy, savory, carby, this soup has it all. This is one of those meals that gets better the next day. I like to make a big batch and eat for a week!</p>
        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 lb bacon</li>
            <li>2 lbs potatoes, cut into eighths</li>
            <li>3 stalks celery, chopped</li>
            <li>1 or 2 large onions, chopped</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons minced garlic</li>
            <li>4 cups half-and-half cream</li>
            <li>3/4 cups flour</li>
            <li>2/3 cups butter</li>
            <li>6 cups chicken stock</li>
            <li>8 oz shredded cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>8 oz sour cream</li>
            <li>chives, for garnish</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In the bottom of a large stockpot cook the bacon until crispy. Drain and chop into bite sized pieces and set aside</li>
            <li>Reserve enough bacon grease to cook the onion and garlic in. Saute until almost tender</li>
            <li>Add the stock and cut potatoes to the pot. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat. Cook until the potatoes are very tender</li>
            <li>In a seperate pan, melt butter and add the flour. Whisk until smooth. Gradually stir in 2 cups of the half-and-half and heat until thickened</li>
            <li>Add the thickened mixture to the stockpot, along with the bacon and the rest of the half-and-half. Season to taste. I usually use salt, pepper, and paprika at a minimum</li>
            <li>Add half the cheese and sour cream. Once the soup is thickened to your liking, serve. Garnish with cheese, sour cream, and chives.</li>
        </ol>
