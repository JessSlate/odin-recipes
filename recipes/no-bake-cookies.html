    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>My simple chocolate peanut butter no-bake cookie recipe. Perfect for dessert!</p>
    <p>This recipe can be a bit tricky if you're not used to making candy, as you need to boil the sugar for the right amount of time to ensure the cookies 
        set up just right, without being too runny or too crumbly. </p>
    <p>My trick is to wait until the sugar mixture is boiling <em>well</em> before starting the timer. 
        I recommend getting the oats and peanut butter measured out before beginning, as the sugar mixture sets up fast after it's taken off the heat.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups white sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 cups milk</li>
        <li>1 stick butter</li>
        <li>1/4 cup baker's cocoa powder</li>
        <li>3 cups quick oats</li>
        <li>1 cup smooth peanut butter</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon imitation vanilla (imitation vanilla won't lose its flavor as much when heated)</li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>In a saucepan, milk, sugar, butter, and cocoa powder to a boil over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Wait until the whole surface of the mixture is boiling, then allow to keep boiling for one minute</li>
        <li>Immediately remove from heat and add in oats, briefly stir to incorporate. Add in the peanut butter and vanilla extract, stir until incorporated.</li>
        <li>Spoon the wet cookie mixture onto a parchment or foil lined cookie sheet and allow to set up. </li>
    </ol>
    <p>I like to put mine in the fridge,
        but this isn't necessary for them to harden. After about 30 minutes the cookies should be set. If you got the boiling just right
         the cookies should be soft without leaving residue on your fingers.</p>
